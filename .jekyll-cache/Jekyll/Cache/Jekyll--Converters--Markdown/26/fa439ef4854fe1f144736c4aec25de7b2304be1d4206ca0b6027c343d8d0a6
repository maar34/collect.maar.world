I"	<p>A work done by an artist and a community at the same time. Maar World is born between individual and collective experiences. An accumulation of learning from artists in Uruguay, Chile, and global upbringing.</p>

<p>This movement represents an explosion of innovation and a continuation of tradition, a letâ€™s go together, another world is possible.
Time to build bridges, blur borders, and create from the love that unites us and sustains us as individuals united in the form of a network, and not an abyss.</p>

<p>A human-machine commonwealth, from the painting of my hands on a mask to the machine learning models that reinterpret these creations and expand the stories of an imaginary world, a representation of my world where my cosmopolitan ancestry lives and interacts with a global village.</p>

<p>The global village looking for affection, love, and spaces free from human influence that allows it to regenerate, and therefore, heal us, and take care of us.</p>
