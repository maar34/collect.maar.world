I"š<p>NFC (Near Field Communication) is a technology designed to simplify and accelerate data exchange between devices. Its initial focus was on revolutionizing payment systems by enabling fast and secure transmission of payment information without complex registration processes. As an international transmission standard, NFC enables contactless data exchange over short distances of 1-4 cm.</p>

<p>Every NFC-enabled device, including smartphones and dedicated NFC readers, can read the information on an NFC chip. The information stored on the NFC chip can provide an enhanced experience associated with the card, and with a dedicated NFC app, users can access metadata related to the NFT (non-fungible token) side of that card.</p>

<p>Place your device close to the card Tag, and it should read the data on it.
To use the NFC Tag Reader for data transmission, the distance between the reading device and the NFC tag must be 1.5 inches or 4 centimeters.</p>

<p>Any NFC reader that supports the NTAG215 Chip can read the cards. Both PC and MAC users can find suitable hardware and software for this purpose in the market.</p>

<h1 id="ios">iOS</h1>

<p>iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS and XS Max, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone SE (2022), iPhone 13, iPhone 14 already had background tag scanning, allowing users to scan NFC tags without any user action. For iOS users, NFC21 Tools and NFC21 Reader are recommended for reading NFC tags.
The iOS 14 release from Apple now includes a native NFC tag reader on iPhone 7, 8, and X models, eliminating the need for a separate App to scan NFC tags. However, users of iPhones 6 and earlier cannot scan NFC tags with or without an App.</p>
