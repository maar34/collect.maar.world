card_description: In the midst of a raging storm at sea, the waves are a symphony of regularity and chaos, a constant flow of energy that holds within it micro and macro frequencies. Beneath the surface, strange and beautiful beings thrive, communicating through a language of song and movement. The sea is not just a body of water, but a living entity, pulsing with life and energy. The ambient music of the sea can be heard in the crashing of the waves, the whispers of the tide, and the symphony of creatures that call it home.
