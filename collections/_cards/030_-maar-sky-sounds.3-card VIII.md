card_description: Forces of attraction and repulsion are not always what they seem. The near-opposites, those things that seem to be in opposition, are often drawn together. This is true not only in the realm of physics, with the pull of magnetism, but also in the realm of philosophy. The duality of life and death, light and dark, good and evil, all hold within them a certain attraction. This attraction is not always obvious, but it is there, pulling and pushing at the same time. This is the dance of existence, the ebb and flow of life, the push and pull of the multiverse. It is a reminder that the world is not always as it seems, and that sometimes, the things we think are in opposition, are in fact, intimately connected.
