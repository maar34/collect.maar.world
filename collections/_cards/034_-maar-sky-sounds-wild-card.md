card_description: The world of Maar is a place of wonder and secrets, where the stars dance in the sky and the colors of the world sing. It is a Circumbinary planet, where two suns embrace, and four moons keep watch. A world where triune brain beings roam, creatures of infinite creation and curiosity. The Maar, a volcanic crater, is the heart of this world. It was born from a fiery kiss between the ground and the water, and it holds within it a lake as calm as a dream. The Maar is a place of pilgrimage, where the people of Maar come to listen to the whispers of the world and the songs of the stars. The Maar has been a source of inspiration for the people since ancient times. They have woven myths and legends around it, and they have created music that echoes its beauty and power. Music is woven into the fabric of their society, it is the rhythm of their days and the melody of their nights.
