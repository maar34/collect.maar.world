card_description: In the depths of the underground caverns, the acoustic coloration is caused by echoes, reverberations and effects related to climatic factors. It is understood that the sound of the land is not just background noise, but a fundamental part of the natural world to be respected and protected. The use of these echoes and reverberations to create music and stories that reflect the soundscapes of the surroundings is an advantage. The acoustic coloration is also acknowledged to be affected by the climate, and the ability to predict and adapt to these changes is developed. The sound of the land is seen as a reminder of the beauty and power of nature and the importance of preserving it for future generations.
