Maar World is a worldbuilding project that combines music and virtual worlds to create a unique and immersive experience for its users. Inspired by real history, science fiction, visual arts, and music, Maar World is a proof of concept for the development of new tools in a creator-owned economy.

As the first of many entangled worlds, Maar World creates an aural dimension that is compatible with the current state of musical creation and virtual worlds.
