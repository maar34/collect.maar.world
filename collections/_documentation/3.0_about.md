A work done by an artist and a community at the same time. Maar World is born between individual and collective experiences. An accumulation of learning from artists in Uruguay, Chile, and global upbringing.

This movement represents an explosion of innovation and a continuation of tradition, a let's go together, another world is possible.
Time to build bridges, blur borders, and create from the love that unites us and sustains us as individuals united in the form of a network, and not an abyss.

A human-machine commonwealth, from the painting of my hands on a mask to the machine learning models that reinterpret these creations and expand the stories of an imaginary world, a representation of my world where my cosmopolitan ancestry lives and interacts with a global village.

The global village looking for affection, love, and spaces free from human influence that allows it to regenerate, and therefore, heal us, and take care of us.
