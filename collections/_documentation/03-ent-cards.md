### ENT Cards
A new paradigm for music distribution of independent artists, merging physical and digital releases, music making and listening. 

#### Front

On the front side of each card, you can find several identifying features, including:

1. Frame color indicating which suit of cards is related to a particular suit or track.
1. Unique artwork for each card.
1. Storytelling sentence that forms part of a larger narrative, immersing players in the world.
1. Card number that indicates the specific track variation.

#### Back

On the back side of the card, you'll find:

1. UFO quantity that identifies which edition the card belongs to, making it easier to keep track the edition of your collection.
1. In physical cards, you will find an [NFC](/docs/ent-worlds/glossary.html#nfc) chip that provides access to the Orbiter, as well as files containing the card metadata, the Certificate of Authenticity, and the NFT contract associated with the card's edition.
