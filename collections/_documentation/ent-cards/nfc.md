### Each ENT Card includes an NFC Chip. 

[NFC](/docs/ent-worlds/glossary.html#nfc) (Near Field Communication) is a technology designed to simplify and accelerate data exchange between devices. Its initial focus was on revolutionizing payment systems by enabling fast and secure transmission of payment information without complex registration processes. As an international transmission standard, NFC enables contactless data exchange over short distances of 1-4 cm.

Every NFC-enabled device, including smartphones and dedicated NFC readers, can read the information on an NFC chip. The information stored on the NFC chip can provide an enhanced experience associated with the card, and with a dedicated NFC app like <a href="https://www.wakdev.com/en/apps.html" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a>, users can access metadata related to the NFT (non-fungible token) side of that card.

Place your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFC-enabled_mobile_devices" target="_blank">compatible device</a> close to the card Tag, and it should read the data on it.
To use the NFC Tag Reader for data transmission, the distance between the reading device and the NFC tag must be 1.5 inches or 4 centimeters.


### PC & MAC 

Any NFC reader that supports the NTAG215 Chip can read the cards. Both PC and MAC users can find suitable hardware and software for this purpose in the market.


### iOS 

iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS and XS Max, iPhone 11, iPhone 12, iPhone SE (2022), iPhone 13, iPhone 14 already had background tag scanning, allowing users to scan NFC tags without any user action. For iOS users, NFC21 Tools and NFC21 Reader are recommended for reading NFC tags.
The iOS 14 release from Apple now includes a native NFC tag reader on iPhone 7, 8, and X models, eliminating the need for a separate App to scan NFC tags. However, users of iPhones 6 and earlier cannot scan NFC tags with or without an App.

For iPhone 7 till iPhone X models, 
the NFC tag reader should be within the Control Center of your iPhone by default. 

# Android 

To use NFC on your Android phone, ensure that you have the latest Android version and activate the NFC switch in Settings > More. This will also activate the Android Beam function, which operates together with NFC. If Android Beam is disabled, it can restrict NFC's sharing capabilities.

For Android users interested in NFC, Google Play Store offers a wide range of NFC apps for reading NFC tags. Here are some of the most useful apps:

- NXP Tag Writer: A comprehensive NFC app from leading NFC chip manufacturer NXP for writing various data types onto NFC tags.
- NFC TagInfo by NXP: An app for reading detailed information of products with NFC chips.
- NFC Trigger: An app with multiple functions for changing smartphone settings, launching apps, social media login, sending messages and 
activating an alarm, suitable for those who seek a feature-rich app.

Nokia NFC Writer is one of the few apps available for Windows phone users.
