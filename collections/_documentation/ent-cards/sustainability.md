### Human-Centered Technology.

Maar World proposes to develop technologies that support projects to expand human possibilities as creators, instead of gradually dehumanizing the creative process. The focus is on what a creative mind can achieve with these tools, rather than the tools dictating the creative process. This involves transitioning from the era of "tools used by humans" to the era of "tools that walk with humans". By prioritizing the human experience and creativity, Maar World seeks to create technologies that empower, inspire, and amplify human potential in creative endeavors.

### Looking for an harmony between artisanship and automation.

Maar World is a project that seeks to balance the benefits of traditional, handmade craftsmanship with the efficiency and consistency of machine-based production. The project aims to preserve the beauty and uniqueness of handcrafted items while utilizing technology to increase production capacity, quality, and affordability. By combining traditional craftsmanship with modern manufacturing techniques, Maar World strives to create sustainable, profitable, and socially responsible businesses. The project recognizes the value of skilled workmanship while also acknowledging the potential benefits of automation in improving productivity and reducing waste.


### 100% ecologically Produced in Italy with Solar Energy Powered Production. 

In constant search of sustainability, Maar World partened a company that use rigorously selected topnotch printing and packaging machinery powered by the greenest choices in energy and process management. 

### 100% Hand Made Packaging Made in Uruguay. 

For the first collection, we partnered with local artisans to create unique packaging for our cards, suits, and decks. These skilled artisans were carefully selected for their dedication to their craft and their attention to detail, which are reflected in the quality of their work.

Each piece of packaging is crafted with care and precision, using locally-sourced materials that not only support the local economy but also add a unique touch to our products. MW believe that our packaging, just like our cards, should be a work of art in and of itself, and that is why we took the time to find the right artisans who share our vision. MW take pride in knowing that our packaging not only looks beautiful but also has a positive impact on the community around us.

### 100% Eco Friendly Papers And Inks

FSC certified papers and food-grade inks from the best European suppliers that are 100% recyclable.
