All this work has been done by one artist supported by a beloved community. Maar World is born between individual and collective experiences. An accumulation of adventures between Uruguay, Chile, Spain Germany and a global upbringing.

This movement represents a blend of innovation and a continuation of tradition, a let's go together, another world is possible.
Time to build bridges, blur borders, and create from the love that unites us and sustains us as individuals united in the form of a network, and not an abyss.

A human-machine commonwealth, from the brush to the machine learning models that reinterpret these creations and expand the stories of an imaginary world, a representation of Maar World where my cosmopolitan ancestry lives and interacts with a global village.

I hear this Earth calls to our love, let's create toghueter protected areas to allow this planet to regenerate, and so heal and take care of ourselves.
