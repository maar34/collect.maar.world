Our initiative is centered on promoting sustainability, equitable revenue distribution in the music industry, and a more natural and intuitive way of creating and manipulating sound. We believe that music has the power to connect people, spark creativity, and foster a sense of community. However, we also recognize that the traditional music industry has not always been equitable or sustainable, with many artists and creators struggling to make a living from their work.

That's where ENT Worlds comes in. We aim to create a new paradigm for music distribution and creation that is fair, transparent, and accessible to all. Our first project, Maar Worlds, is a proof of concept that demonstrates how physical and digital worlds can intersect to create unique and innovative musical experiences.

Maar Worlds is just the beginning, though. We envision a future where ENT cards are used to distribute music from independent artists all over the world, where interplanetary music players allow anyone to create and manipulate sounds in new and exciting ways, and where decentralized applications and hardware development push the boundaries of what's possible in music.

As we continue to develop and refine our vision, we welcome collaborators, artists, and labels to join us in this exciting journey. Expect new ENT cards releases featuring visual and sound artists, updated interplanetary players, dApps, and hardware development. Together, we can create a more sustainable, equitable, and creative future for music.
