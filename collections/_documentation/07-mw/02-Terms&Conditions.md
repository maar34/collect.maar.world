### PRICING AND SHIPPING POLICY

The sale prices of Maar World products are usually established in US dollars or Ethereum in case of NFT, although they may be established in another legal currency as long as the currency is expressed in legal letters or distinctive signs. Prices are final.

The prices of products offered and/or displayed on the website may vary without prior notice or notification. When making an exchange or return, it will be taken into account if the item was purchased under a special or financial promotion. The price at the time of the exchange will depend on these promotions. For more information, please contact customer service.

Maar World is not responsible for the risk or time of transportation. Indicatively, from the moment the purchase is confirmed, through a confirmation email, until it arrives at the corresponding address, the order may take up to 7 business days to arrive (in Uruguayan territory) and up to 30 days if it is an international shipment.

Maar World is not responsible for legal regulations in each country, nor for the costs, fees, tax requirements or customs requirements of each country. Our international customers are responsible for customs fees within their own country. For more information, please contact the local customs office. Once the order is shipped and the shipment confirmation email is received, Maar World is no longer responsible for the products sent. For any eventualities from that moment on, please contact DHL.
