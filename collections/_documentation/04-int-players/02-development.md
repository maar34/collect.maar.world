<a href="https://p5js.org" target="_blank">p5.js</a> is a JavaScript library that provides a set of tools for creating interactive graphics, animations, and sound in web browsers. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike. With p5.js, developers can create complex visual and audio experiences using simple and intuitive syntax.

<a href="https://rnbo.cycling74.com" target="_blank">RNBO</a>  is a library and toolchain for building and exporting software that incorporates the sound of Max, a popular visual programming language for music and multimedia. With RNBO, users can create a wide range of music-related projects, from web experiences and hardware music devices to audio plugins and new Max objects, all from the same patch.
Additionally, RNBO offers an intuitive, user-friendly interface for patching and experimenting with code, making it accessible to a wide range of users. Overall, RNBO represents an exciting new tool for musicians and programmers alike, offering a powerful and versatile platform for music creation and experimentation.

### Desktop Version.
The desktop version is a prototype that may be available upon request.
