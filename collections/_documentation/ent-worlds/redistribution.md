ENT Worlds is a remarkable initiative that aims to strike a balance among stakeholders by utilizing a simple formula to address complex problems. Once production costs are covered, all economic gains from the project are distributed among three critical areas: 34% for regeneration, 33% for artists, and 33% for development. The project strives to safeguard and nurture wildlife, promote sustainability and equitable revenue distribution in the music industry, and facilitate a more natural and intuitive approach to creating and manipulating sound. This approach enables more individuals to reactivate their auditory consciousness and explore new dimensions of music and sound that they may not have previously encountered.

Sustainability is not just a matter of reducing waste and using environmentally-friendly materials. It is also about supporting initiatives that promote the regeneration of biodiversity and human nature. We begin this journey supporting the efforts made by a community in Rinc√≥n de Franquia, a region in the triple frontier of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil that has been declared, national protected area and now is looking to protect important islands in the river. 34% of the gains in Skysounds are being directed towards the regeneration of biodiversity, a vital step in reversing the damage that has been done to the natural world. 

The area is home to a diverse range of fauna, with over 200 species of birds alone, making up half of all bird species in the country. Additionally, the space is rich in reptiles and amphibians. The project aims to protect and care for this wildlife, while also providing an opportunity for people to learn about environmental care, the local community is actively involved in the project, and is being trained in environmental care and sustainable tourism practices. 

It is important that we all do our part to support sustainability and the regeneration of biodiversity. Whether it's by supporting local businesses that prioritize environmentally-friendly practices or by getting involved in community initiatives aimed at protecting natural habitats, there are many ways in which we can make a difference.

The music industry has been facing numerous challenges for several years. From publishing problems and contract disputes to a lack of transparency and fairness in revenue distribution, the industry has been in need of a significant overhaul for quite some time. Moreover, the current economic climate with rising inflation and an impending recession has only exacerbated the situation for artists, leading some to even consider abandoning the industry altogether.

However, the emergence of Web3 technology, built on transparency and decentralization, presents a unique opportunity for the music industry to address these issues and create a more sustainable and equitable future for artists. By using blockchain technology, startups can create a decentralized platform where artists can directly interact with their fans and share their creations without intermediaries. This not only allows for more transparency and control over revenue distribution but also promotes a more meaningful connection between artists and their audiences.

Additionally, blockchain technology can facilitate the creation of NFTs or non-fungible tokens, which are unique digital assets that can represent ownership of various items, including music. This technology has significant potential to transform the music industry by enabling artists to monetize their creations more effectively and protect their intellectual property rights. The use of ENT cards, which combine NFT technology with physical distribution, could provide collectors with a unique and tangible representation of their favorite music while also granting access to digital versions of the same.

However, it's essential to recognize that physical distribution remains a vital aspect of music culture. Vinyl records, for instance, have experienced a resurgence in recent years, and many collectors have a strong preference for physical formats. It's crucial to preserve and celebrate this aspect of music culture, especially for the sake of music history and collector's tastes.

The integration of both physical and digital distribution is crucial for reaching wider audiences and finding a balance between the two. By using ENT cards, collectors can own a physical representation of their favorite music, while also having access to the digital version. Moreover, ENT cards could facilitate the development of new business models that combine physical and digital distribution and promote a more sustainable and equitable future for the music industry.

In conclusion, the music industry is at a turning point, and the adoption of Web3 technology could transform the industry, providing new ways for artists to interact with their audiences, protect their intellectual property rights, and monetize their creations effectively. The use of blockchain technology and ENT cards, which combine NFT technology with physical distribution, presents a unique opportunity for the music industry to find a balance between physical and digital distribution and create a more transparent and fair industry for everyone involved.

### 33% Development 

33% Development. The world of music listening and creation is constantly evolving.

We are designing an accessible system that can be controlled in the beginning from browsers, and in the near future by an apps allowing users to use their device's sensors, speakers, vibrotactile feedback system, and touch screen to control the sound. This allows for a more natural and intuitive way of creating and manipulating sound, and gives users more control over the creative process.

We are also exploring the use of other elements of the interfaces,new instruments for musical expression, mathematical models, and machine learning to create a holistic management system. This will allow us to develop a network of meta-musical instruments that can play with any type of sound, and provide a user experience that is both satisfying and intuitive.

However, it's important to note that our app is not just another tool to create perfect music and recordings. We want it to be an instrument with different levels of understanding, capable of achieving satisfactory results with a simple tutorial, but also room for improvement in sound performance. 

As we develop this product, we are also committed to circular design processes that provide agility and adaptability in the developments, texts, and creations of new artistic proposals.
