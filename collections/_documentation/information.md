### Beyond Conventions: A New Era of Aural Creations Born at the Intersection of Art, Science, and Technology

Entangled creations born at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds, an imaginary that crosses the borders of scientific discoveries, technological development and artistic creation. Maar world is a proof of concept for a new era of aural creations in a creator-owned creative economy. 

### The Cosmopolitan Ancestry of Maar World: A Global Village Connected by Love and Creativity

All this work has been done by one artist supported by a beloved community. Maar World is born between individual and collective experiences. An accumulation of adventures between Uruguay, Chile, Spain Germany and a global upbringing.

This movement represents a blend of innovation and a continuation of tradition, a let's go together, another world is possible.Time to build bridges, blur borders, and create from the love that unites us and sustains us as individuals united in the form of a network, and not an abyss.

A human-machine commonwealth, from the brush to the machine learning models that reinterpret these creations and expand the stories of an imaginary world, a representation of Maar World where my cosmopolitan ancestry lives and interacts with a global village.

I hear this Earth calls to our love, let's create toghueter protected areas to allow this planet to regenerate, and so heal and take care of ourselves.
