Sustainability is not just a matter of reducing waste and using environmentally-friendly materials. It is also about supporting initiatives that promote the regeneration of biodiversity and human nature. We begin this journey supporting the efforts made by a community in Rinc√≥n de Franquia, a region in the triple frontier of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil that has been declared, national protected area and now is looking to protect important islands in the river. 34% of the gains in Skysounds are being directed towards the regeneration of biodiversity, a vital step in reversing the damage that has been done to the natural world.

Of course, sustainability is just one aspect of a larger issue. The danger of collapse of natural habitats is caused by a variety of factors, deforestation, and pollution. Addressing these issues will require a concerted effort from governments, businesses, and individuals around the world.

It is important that we all do our part to support sustainability and the regeneration of biodiversity. Whether it's by supporting local businesses that prioritize environmentally-friendly practices or by getting involved in community initiatives aimed at protecting natural habitats, there are many ways in which we can make a difference.

The music industry is facing a crisis. With the current rise in inflation and impending recession, many artists are considering abandoning the industry. Publishing problems, rights, contracts, and a lack of confidence in the industry are just some of the issues that artists face. This skepticism and lack of credibility can be seen as a result of the industry's practices, including the descaling of the work of artists and craftsmen.

To make matters worse, last year, the three biggest record labels made a staggering $18.2 billion, but the artists received less than 12% of that revenue. The industry has always managed to keep on top of emerging technology and manipulate it in its favour, but the difference with Web3 technology is that it's built on transparency. This makes it much more difficult for industry middlemen to justify their involvement when this new wave of technology explicitly doesn't require them.

A new era of hybrid artistic and tech projects operating on the blockchain will have access to a new way to increase the aggregate efficiency of our economic activity. This will be a key tool to feed, manage and move the artist economy of the future. By using blockchain technology, projects can create a decentralized platform where artists can directly interact with their fans, and share their creations for remixing purposes without the need for intermediaries. 

Overall, the music industry needs to embrace the changes brought on by Web3 technology. It's time to move away from the outdated practices of the past and create a more transparent and fair industry for everyone involved. By using blockchain technology, startups have an opportunity to create a new ecosystem for the music industry, creating in balance with communities of artists, technicians, designers and developers the tools we need to thrive and succeed. With the right technology, we can reduce the difference between the real world and utopia and create a brighter future for the music industry.

We are designing an accessible system that can be controlled in the beginning from browsers, and in the near future by an apps allowing users to use their device's sensors, speakers, vibrotactile feedback system, and touch screen to control the sound. This allows for a more natural and intuitive way of creating and manipulating sound, and gives users more control over the creative process.

We are also exploring the use of other elements of the interfaces,new instruments for musical expression, mathematical models, and machine learning to create a holistic management system. This will allow us to develop a network of meta-musical instruments that can play with any type of sound, and provide a user experience that is both satisfying and intuitive.

However, it's important to note that our app is not just another tool to create perfect music and recordings. We want it to be an instrument with different levels of understanding, capable of achieving satisfactory results with a simple tutorial, but also room for improvement in sound performance. 

As we develop this product, we are also committed to circular design processes that provide agility and adaptability in the developments, texts, and creations of new artistic proposals.
