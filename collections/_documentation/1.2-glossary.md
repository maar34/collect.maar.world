### Aural Community 
Aural Community, combines the use of concepts and tools of acoustic ecology, soundscape, sound design for video games, generative music, artificially creative musical systems, and new interfaces for musical expression. Inspired by the acoustic community model, we plan a gradual implementation in stages that in the future will create tools that will allow users to create, share, buy and sell music, sound effects, co-creating the sound community.


### Acoustic Community 
An acoustic community is defined as an aggregation of species that produces sound by using 12 internal or extra-body sound-producing tools. Such communities occur in aquatic (freshwater and 13 marine) and terrestrial environments. An acoustic community is the biophonic component of a 14 soundtope and is characterized by its acoustic signature, which results from the distribution of 15 sonic information associated with signal amplitude and frequency. Distinct acoustic communities 16 can be described according to habitat, the frequency range of the acoustic signals, and the time of 17 day or the season. Near and far fields can be identified empirically, thus the acoustic community 18 can be used as a proxy for biodiversity richness. <a href="[https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/39080/13/BIO-D-15-00183R2%20cropped%20(3).pdf]" target="_blank">Farina, James, The acoustic communities : definition,
description and ecological role</a>

### Soundscape 
An environment of SOUND (or sonic environment) with emphasis on the way it is perceived and understood by the individual, or by a society. It thus depends on the relationship between the individual and any such environment. The term may refer to actual environments, or to abstract constructions such as musical compositions and tape montages, particularly when considered as an artificial environment. <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio-webdav/handbook/Soundscape.html" target="_blank">Truax, Handbook for Acoustic Ecology</a>

### ENT Music Players 

ENT Music Players are a network of intelligent music tools that use algorithmic approaches to facilitate music listening and creation, allowing users to take control of their sound in new and exciting ways. These tools are designed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of musical training or technical knowledge, and aim to reactivate auditory consciousness and push the boundaries of what's possible in musical creation and exploration
