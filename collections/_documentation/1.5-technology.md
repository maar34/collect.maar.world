      <p> We propose to use these technologies to support projects that expand our possibilities as human creators instead of gradually dehumanizing the creative process. We believe it is interesting what a creative mind can do with these tools, not the other way around. Thus transitioning from the era of "tools used by humans" to the era of tools that walk with humans. </p>
